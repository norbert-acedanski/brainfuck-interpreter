# brainfuck-interpreter

# About The Project
Script is an interpreter for Brainfuck programming language.

# Built With
Python 3.9.10

# Getting started

1. Remember, everything except 8 basic characters ('<', '>', '+', '-', '.', ',', '[', ']') in Brainfuck is a comment.
2. You can write description of the program at the beginning enclosed in '[]' brackets, that may contain some of the basic instructions (interpreter will skip the entire loop). Everything after is an actual program.
3. Script checks for the number of brackets used (if they are not equal, script will generate a message with location of the abnormal bracket and will stop execution).

### Working with brainfuck-interpreter:
1. Write or copy the program to the *brain_fuck_program.txt* file and save it.
2. Set *print_original_brainfuck_program* and  *print_instructions_without_comments* variables accordingly.
3. Run the script.
4. After successful execution, result should be visible in the terminal window.

# Usage
Print the result of the Brainfuck programming language out of boredom.
Project contains simple "Hello World!" program in *brain_fuck_program.txt* file.
